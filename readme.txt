Things to do when you start a new project before pushing it
You have to add manually the folders gsl and cppitertools available on moodle
to be able to use many libraries such as span or range
Also make sure to set the language standard to c++20
And update the warning level to W4

IMPORTANT

For each folder, you create for a lab, the name should respect: Lab_X where X is the lab number
Don't forget it is cas sensitive so 'l' different of 'L'
